## How to Update VLM Model Benchmarks

### Purpose
Periodically evaluate VLM (Vision Language Model) cost-performance for analyzing VRT diff images.

### Steps

1. **Check available models** (dynamically fetched from OpenRouter API):
```bash
pkf run vlm-bench -- --list --max-cost 0.001 --limit 30
```

2. **Run fix-loop with candidate models** (hard case: seed 11):
```bash
VLMKIT_VLM_MODEL="<model-id>" node --experimental-strip-types src/experiments/css-challenge/fix-loop.ts \
  --fixture page --seed 11 --mode selector --max-rounds 2
```

3. **Measure VLM quality** (token count, latency, CHANGE detection count):
```bash
pkf run vlm-bench -- <model1> <model2> <model3> --md
```

4. **Update results in the "VLM Model Comparison" section of `docs/knowledge.md`**

5. **Save report to `docs/reports/`**:
```bash
# Filename: YYYY-MM-DD-vlm-model-benchmark-vN.md
```

### Evaluation Criteria
- Fix Loop: whether seed 11 (`.readme-body pre` 6 props, 4.1% diff) reaches FIXED
- Speed: VLM latency (1-10s acceptable range)
- Cost: /call (guideline: below $0.5e-7 is cheap)
- CHANGE detection count: number of changes following structured format (7-15 is optimal)

### Current Recommendations (2026-05-19)
- **Default**: `bytedance/ui-tars-1.5-7b` (~1.35s, ~$0/call) — UI-domain-trained, fastest of the structured outputs. Verified FIXED in round 1 on seed 11 (.readme-body pre, 4.1% diff).
- **Stable / detailed**: `qwen/qwen3-vl-30b-a3b-instruct` (~2.0s) — emits hex codes directly.
- **Baseline fallback**: `amazon/nova-lite-v1` (~2.4s).
- **High coverage + prose root-cause**: `claude:claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (~4.2s, ~$2e-6/call). Also FIXED in round 1 on seed 11 — works as Stage-1 VLM in the 2-stage pipeline despite format divergence; Stage-2 LLM handles it. The earlier "only when VLM is consumed directly" caveat was too conservative.

#### Avoid / re-evaluate
- `meta-llama/llama-4-scout` — regressed since 2026-04-04 (was 1.0s, now ~7s with conversational output)
- `meta-llama/llama-4-maverick` — claims "image not available" and returns methodology only
- `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` — hallucinates uniform `red → red` deltas

See `docs/reports/2026-05-19-vlm-haiku-vs-uitars.md` for today's 2-way re-bench (haiku + UI-TARS, both FIXED r1);
`docs/reports/2026-05-18-vlm-claude-vs-openrouter-vs-newcomers.md` for the 8-way bench from the prior week.

### `vlm-region-diff` CLI Default (2026-05-23) — DEPRECATED 2026-07-30

**`diff region` is deprecated**: net-negative for agent repair in every
controlled A/B (2026-06-06), and its role is now covered deterministically
by `diff png --elements-html`, `check integrity`, and `check equivalence`.
The model notes below are kept as bench history only.

The defaults above are for **fix-loop VLMs** (Stage-1 CHANGE list + Stage-2 LLM).
`src/experiments/migration/vlm-region-diff.ts` is a different tool — it asks
the VLM directly for `{verdict, regions, baselineColor, variantColor}`. The
two roles call for different models.

- **Default**: `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` (~$0.005/call). Only model that
  returned `diff` with correct *direction* on the 2026-05-23 bake-off
  (expressive-menu component pair, 86% changed pixels). Per-channel hex
  numbers are still off by ~±10 — treat them as vibes, not measurements.
- **Avoid as `vlm-region-diff` default**: `bytedance/ui-tars-1.5-7b` (returns
  `diff` verdict but every region reports `baselineColor == variantColor`),
  `qwen/qwen3-vl-30b-a3b-instruct` and `google/gemini-2.5-flash` (both
  return `no-diff` on a ~6% palette shift across the entire image).

The `ui-tars` recommendation in the section above is unchanged — it remains
the fix-loop Stage-1 VLM default. It just fails specifically at the
`vlm-region-diff` job of naming color literals.

Full bench: `docs/reports/2026-05-23-vlm-region-diff-bakeoff.md`.

**A/B caveat (2026-06-06)**: in the controlled control-vs-vlmkit repair
runs, `diff region` was net-negative for agent-driven repair in every
run that tried it (wrong selector attribution, fabricated deltas —
drafts 06/09). For agent repair loops prefer the deterministic
`diff png --elements-html` path (selector candidates + shift estimates,
no VLM). See `docs/reports/2026-06-06-ab-external-synthesis.md`.

**Refutation gate (2026-06-08)**: `diff region` now cross-checks each
VLM claim against the measured bbox pixels. When the measured average
channel delta is below `PIXEL_REFUTE_FLOOR` (3) the row is demoted to
`confidence: low`, flagged `verification.refuted` in the JSON report,
and segregated into an "Unverified — measured pixels refute the VLM
claim" markdown section. This blunts the worst of 06/09 (zero-delta
rows no longer read as findings) but the deterministic path is still
the recommended default.

### Stage-2 LLM Recommendations (2026-05-22)

Hard case: `ui-tars-1.5-7b` VLM + various LLMs, seed 11 selector mode.
Full bench: `docs/reports/2026-05-22-vlm-llm-coverage-bench.md`.

- **Default**: `google/gemini-2.5-flash` via OpenRouter — **7s total, ~$0.008/run**, FIXED r1 with 11 fixes. Beats the previous `claude:claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` default on both axes (~10s, ~$0.020).
- **Cheapest still-correct (batch / cost-sensitive)**: `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` — **~$0.002/run**, 43s, FIXED r1. Picks up 37 fix candidates; over-generation absorbed by the apply-and-rollback gate. Note: only suitable as LLM Stage-2 — its VLM mode is in the avoid list above.
- **Independent second opinion (no Google deps)**: `moonshotai/kimi-k2` — 20s, ~$0.011/run, FIXED r1.
- **Anthropic-direct baseline**: `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` — 10s, ~$0.020/run, FIXED r1. Useful for cross-provider sanity.

#### Avoid for Stage-2 fix synthesis
- `moonshotai/kimi-k2-thinking` — hallucinates multi-token garbage selectors (`aside#cdl figcaptionSupplymonth proportionatefailures` etc.); 47s LLM latency.
- `moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`, `moonshotai/kimi-k2.6` — return 0 fixes despite VLM CHANGE list (emits prose-only, not structured JSON). LLM latency 40-100s also disqualifies them.
- `qwen/qwen3-coder` — generates plausible-looking fixes that over-correct the whole page (diff 4.1% → 46.7%); apply-and-rollback catches it but the loop never recovers.

## Component-focused VRT (fixing one component with a small image)

```bash
# Runnable example: a plain-JS gallery, no dev server or bundler needed.
cd examples/story-gallery
G="file://$PWD/index.html"
vlmkit check story components/Button/Primary Card/Default --gallery "$G"   # writes baselines
vlmkit check story components/Button/Primary Card/Default --gallery "$G"   # compares
vlmkit check story components/Button/Primary --gallery "$G" --update-baseline
```

Use this instead of `diff html` when repairing ONE component: the shot is the
component's own box (~47x fewer pixels than the viewport on the example), and a
change to one component does not make its neighbours report.

`check story` drives the Playwright **gallery contract** — `window.mount({ story,
props })` / `window.unmount()` rendering into `#root` — via `page.evaluate`, which
is how Playwright's own `mount` fixture works. Consequences:

- **No Playwright version floor.** The `mount` fixture is 1.62+; the repo pins
  1.61 and this does not use the fixture. Do not add a peer-dep bump for it.
- The gallery is framework-specific and the project's to own; `examples/story-gallery/README.md`
  carries a React + Vite one to copy. Storybook needs a shim (no `window.mount`).
- Baselines are keyed on the story id **as written**, so `Button/Primary` and
  `components/Button/Primary` get separate baselines. List the canonical spelling
  in `vlmkit.gates.json`.

## Explanatory animations (`vlmkit-anim`) and their evaluation loop

```bash
vlmkit-anim schema --kind sort                      # the writing guide for one kind (docs/anim-ir.md has all fourteen)
vlmkit-anim check scene.json                        # validate → compile → semantic checks → stats; exit 1 on ✗
vlmkit-anim explain scene.json                      # narration as a numbered list
vlmkit-anim render scene.json --step 4 --out f.svg  # one frame, headless and deterministic
vlmkit-anim html scene.json --out page.html         # <vlm-anim> runtime inline; `vlmkit check animation page.html` works on it
vlmkit-anim video scene.json --out demo.gif --width 480   # GIF encoded in-process; .mp4/.webm run ffmpeg or leave frames + the command
```

`vlmkit-anim` is a **standalone binary** (`@mizchi/vlmkit-anim`, no workspace
dependencies), not a `vlmkit` subcommand; it shares vlmkit's evaluation gates as
a consumer (`vlmkit check animation` on its pages). In this repo run it as
`pnpm exec vlmkit-anim …` (resolves to `dist/`, so `pnpm --filter @mizchi/vlmkit-anim build`
after editing `src/`) or, without a build, `node --experimental-strip-types packages/vlmkit-anim/src/cli.ts …`.

The IR is judged on two things, measured by fresh subagents rather than by
reading the code: **an agent gets it right from `docs/anim-ir.md` alone**, and
**intent is readable when someone edits the file later**. Scenario fixture:
`fixtures/anim-scenario/` (briefs, a re-edit task, per-agent attempts).
Procedure is the `agent-validation-loop` skill; prompt the agent with one brief
and the guide, forbid `packages/vlmkit-anim/` and other attempts, and record
first-attempt ✗ count, rounds to green, scene bytes, and its friction verbatim.
Reports: `docs/reports/2026-09-04-anim-ir-v*.md`.

## Measuring Gate / Rule Execution Cost

```bash
# One run, per-phase split (parse / run / findings / rules / format / ledger)
vlmkit check integrity page.html --timing

# Every gate that works from a bare page (18 of 26 when measured 2026-08-06; `check story`
# landed the next day), ranked by cost, with yield
vlmkit bench gates fixtures/css-challenge/page.html --repeat 3

# Full corpus + the "does turning rules off save time" probe, as markdown
vlmkit bench gates fixtures/css-challenge/{page,dashboard,form-app}.html \
  --repeat 3 --probe-suppression --md --out docs/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-gate-bench.md
```

**Per-rule cost is attributed, not isolated, and that is structural.** A gate does
one measurement (`run`) and every rule it declares reads that same report, so
`run` is ~100% of wall clock and the projection is under a millisecond across all
18 gates. Consequences worth remembering before optimizing anything:

- `--rule x=off` does **not** speed up a run (settings apply after the
  measurement). Measured at +0.4% — noise.
- The cost unit is the **gate**. Spend less by dropping a gate or narrowing its
  inputs (fewer viewports, no `--sweep`, shorter `--observe`).
- Four gates are ~60% of a full sweep: `check interactions`, `stress media`,
  `check perf`, `check integrity`. `check interactions` varies 5x by page.

Baseline: `docs/reports/2026-08-06-gate-rule-cost-bench.md`.

## Running CSS Challenge Benchmarks

### Cross-fixture Matrix
```bash
NO_IMAGES=1 node --experimental-strip-types src/experiments/css-challenge/css-challenge-bench.ts \
  --fixture all --mode selector --trials 10 --no-db
```

### Crater Prescanner Bench (requires crater server running)
```bash
# Start crater
cd ~/ghq/github.com/mizchi/crater && just build-bidi && just start-bidi-with-font

# Run bench
pkf run css-bench-crater -- --fixture page --trials 30
```

### Tracking Detection Rate
```bash
pkf run css-report  # Aggregate accumulated data
```

## Running Migration VRT

```bash
# Tailwind → vanilla CSS
pkf run migration-tailwind

# Reset CSS comparison
pkf run migration-reset

# File comparison
vlmkit diff html before.html after.html

# URL comparison
vlmkit diff html --url http://localhost:3000/ --current-url http://localhost:8080/

# With masks (exclude dynamic content)
vlmkit diff html --url http://localhost:3000/ --current-url http://localhost:8080/ --mask ".marquee-container,.hero-badge"
```

## Snapshot (URL → multi-viewport capture)

```bash
# First run: create baseline. Subsequent runs: baseline + diff
vlmkit snapshot http://localhost:3000/ http://localhost:3000/about/ --output snapshots/

# With masks (exclude animated/dynamic elements)
vlmkit snapshot http://localhost:3000/ --mask ".marquee-container,.hero-badge"
```

## Dogfooding

```bash
# luna.mbt (requires: npx serve ~/ghq/.../luna.mbt/dist/luna -p 4200)
pkf run dogfood-luna

# sol.mbt (requires: npx serve ~/ghq/.../sol.mbt/website/dist-docs -p 3000)
pkf run dogfood-sol

# False positive test (compare same URL twice)
pkf run false-positive --url http://localhost:3000/luna/
```

## Running Fix Loop

```bash
# Property mode (delete 1 CSS property)
pkf run fix-loop -- --fixture page --seed 42

# Selector mode (delete 1 selector block)
pkf run fix-loop -- --fixture page --seed 11 --mode selector --max-rounds 3

# Specify a VLM model
VLMKIT_VLM_MODEL="bytedance/ui-tars-1.5-7b" pkf run fix-loop -- --fixture page --seed 11 --mode selector
```

| `VLMKIT_LLM_MODEL` | LLM model | Provider default |
| `VLMKIT_VLM_MODEL` | VLM model (OpenRouter / `gemini:` / `claude:`) | bytedance/ui-tars-1.5-7b |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | OpenRouter API key | — |

### Which model to set, by who is asking

Set your own family's model so a run is reproducible from the transcript. The same table is in
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md), which is what a non-Claude agent reads, and
`tests/agent-model-defaults.test.mjs` pins the two to each other and to the code.

- **Claude Code** (this file's reader): `VLMKIT_VLM_MODEL=claude:claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`,
  `VLMKIT_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic` — the benchmarked recommendations above.
- **Codex / any OpenAI-based agent**: `VLMKIT_VLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-5.6-luna` and
  `VLMKIT_LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter VLMKIT_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-5.6-luna`.

`openai` is **not** a provider name — there is no `api.openai.com` client and no `OPENAI_API_KEY`
in this codebase, and the `openai/` in the id is an OpenRouter catalogue prefix. Setting
`VLMKIT_LLM_PROVIDER=openai` fails with `INVALID_PROVIDER`; the message now names the route, and
`OPENAI_DEFAULT_MODEL` in `packages/vlmkit-ai/src/llm-client.ts` is the one place the id is written.

## Package Layout

This repository is a pnpm workspace.

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `packages/vlmkit-core/` | Image / CSS / DOM / a11y diff engine + shared types and CLI helpers. No Playwright or AI deps required to import core types. |
| `packages/vlmkit-core/src/plugin/` | **Gate plugin runtime**: the contract (`defineGate` / `definePlugin`), rule tables and settings, the registry, and the core runner that owns `--help` / `--json` / `--advisory` / the run ledger / the exit code. Core never imports a gate — definitions are handed to it. |
| `packages/vlmkit-markup/src/gates/` | Gate definitions (`*.gate.ts`) + the main built-in plugin (`index.ts`) — 25 of the 27 gates. Wraps existing measurement code; adding a gate is `defineGate` + one line in `index.ts`. |
| `packages/vlmkit-capture/src/gates/`, `src/gates/` | The other two built-in plugins: `check crater` (capture) and `check perf` (app-side). Composed by `src/cli/gate-registry.ts` alongside any `vlmkit.config.json` `"plugins"`. |
| `packages/vlmkit-capture/` | Playwright / Crater capture infrastructure, viewport discovery, prescanner. |
| `packages/vlmkit-ai/` | VLM / LLM clients, reasoning pipeline, NLP helpers. |
| `packages/vlmkit-markup/` | VLM-driven markup tooling: component extract / from-image, design tokens, theme parity, i18n stress, palette, dep-graph, selector-heal, smoke-runner. |
| `packages/vlmkit-anim/` | **Explanatory animation IR** (`vlmkit-anim`): Scene IR (sort / array / stack / queue / list / state-machine / heap / tree / distributed / matrix / graph / chart / diagram / vector) → Timeline IR → `<vlm-anim>` runtime (SVG + Web Animations) and headless SVG frames. Writing guide `docs/anim-ir.md`; design `docs/design/anim-ir.md`. Every JSON block in the guide is compiled by `docs.test.ts` — edit the guide and the examples together. |
| `src/cli/` | CLI entry + router + workflow command implementations (split per-command under `cli/workflow/`). |
| `src/api/` | HTTP API server (deep-imports vlmkit-markup smoke-runner + experiments/css-challenge). |
| `src/experiments/` | migration, css-challenge, detection, benchmark, flaker. |
| `src/demo/` | Demo scripts. |
| `src/util/` | App-side helpers (agent, goal-runner, skill, perf, integration tests). |
| `src/vrt/snapshot/`, `src/vrt/compare/` | Baseline / snapshot / flipbook workflow. |

Cross-package imports use `@mizchi/vlmkit-<pkg>/<path>.ts` or the curated barrel `@mizchi/vlmkit-<pkg>`. Within a package, use relative imports. The barrel excludes Playwright-bound and CLI-entry modules — deep-import those. (This line said `@mizchi/vrt-<pkg>`, which no package has been called since 0.6 — an import written from it does not resolve.)

Run tests for a single package: `pnpm --filter @mizchi/vlmkit-core test`. From repo root, `pnpm test` runs all. **Editing a `packages/*/src` file and then running the CLI shows the OLD behavior**: `@mizchi/vlmkit-*` resolves through `exports` to `dist/*.mjs`, so `pnpm build` has to run in between (and never pipe its output to `head` — SIGPIPE leaves a half-deleted `dist/`).

The `vlmkit-markup` markup-core tests build MoonBit sources on demand and need the `moon` CLI. If tests fail with `spawnSync moon ENOENT`, add it to PATH first (it is often installed but not on PATH in sandboxes): `export PATH="$HOME/.moon/bin:$PATH"`. If it is not installed at all: `curl -fsSL https://cli.moonbitlang.com/install/unix.sh | bash`. Without it ~138 tests fail on the toolchain rather than on anything real, so install it before trusting a red suite.

**After editing anything under `.claude/skills/`, run `pnpm sync:skills`.** The content lives there once and is copied into two installer packages (`skills/vlmkit/workflows/`, `.apm/skills/vlmkit/`); `tests/skill-package.test.mjs` fails if the three drift, and hand-editing a copy is the wrong repair.

**Commands invoked from `.github/workflows/` are checked by `tests/workflow-commands.test.mjs`.** Renaming or removing a CLI verb fails that test rather than a 15-minute browser job — or, worse, than nothing at all when the workflow step ends in `|| true`.
