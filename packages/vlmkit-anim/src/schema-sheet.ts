const COMMON = `Common to every scene
  "format": "${SCENE_FORMAT}"      required, exactly this string
  "kind": one of ${SCENE_KINDS.join(" | ")}
  "title": string                  optional; drawn at the top and used as the first caption
  "stepMs": number                 optional; milliseconds per beat (kinds default 500–700)
  "canvas": {"width", "height", "background"}   optional; kinds choose a size that fits
  "theme": {"node","nodeStroke","text","accent","muted","ok","bad","background","fontSize"}  optional colours

Captions are the explanation. Every beat that matters should carry one; the
runtime shows the current caption under the picture and \`vlmkit-anim explain\`
prints them as a numbered list. Write them for the reader, not the machine.
A "caption" on an op replaces the generated one; {"note": "…"} is a captioned
pause and counts as a step; compilers add a first (title / "Start") and a last
("Sorted" / "End") step of their own.

Annotations (every kind, in the same op list — vlmkit-anim schema --kind annotations):
  {"value": {"id", "label", "text", "at"?}}  a readout that tracks a number; same id = update
  {"callout": {"at", "text"} | null}          a pointer at an anchor        {"snapshot": {"of", "label"}}  a frozen copy
  {"group": {"around": [anchors], "label"}}   an outline                    {"text": {"lines": [...], "highlight"}}  a block
  {"relate": {"from", "to", "label"} | null}  a labelled arrow between two anchors ("style": "line" for no head)
  Anchors are what the kind documents: an index, a cell "r,c", a node id, a state, a value. "ms": 0 folds the op into the previous beat.`;

const ANNOTATIONS_SHEET = `Annotations — six ops every kind accepts in its own op / sequence / trace / messages / timeline list.
They add nothing a "vector" scene could not draw by hand; the point is that you never type a coordinate.

  {"value": {"id": "best", "label": "best so far", "text": "1/2"}}      a named readout in the panel on the right;

  {"value": {"id": "vA", "label": "A", "text": "[1,0,0]", "at": "A"}}   …or beside an anchor ("side": above | below | left | right)
  {"callout": {"at": "3", "text": "pivot", "side": "above"}}             a text box with a pointer at the anchor; {"callout": null} hides it;

  {"text": {"lines": ["for i in a:", "  if i > x:"], "highlight": 1}}    a multi-line block (panel, or "at" an anchor); same id + same
                                                                          line count updates in place and moves the highlight; null hides
  {"relate": {"from": "A", "to": "B", "label": "A ≤ B"}}                  a labelled arrow from one anchor to another ("style": "line" for
                                                                          no head); same id redraws it, {"relate": null} removes all.

  Every op takes "caption" (replaces the generated one, e.g. "best so far = 1/2") and "ms" ("ms": 0 = inside the previous beat).
  explain lists value changes as their beats; check names the anchors that exist when one is misspelt.

Anchors by kind (what "at" / "of" / "around" may name):
  sort           a value ("5" = the bar labelled 5, wherever it is)
  array          an index ("3"), a pointer name ("lo"), "window"
  stack / queue  a slot index ("0" = bottom / front), a value, "top" | "front" | "back"
  list           a value, "head", "nil"
  tree           a value, "cursor"
  heap           a slot index ("0" = root), "v7" (the value 7)
  state-machine  a state id, an event name (when only one transition uses it), "from->to", "token"
  distributed    a node id, a message label
  matrix         a cell "r,c", "row:<label or index>", "col:<label or index>"
  graph          a node id, an edge "a->b"
  chart          a series id, a category, "series/category"
  diagram        a node id, an edge "a->b"
  vector         a node id`;

                                   "at" defaults to right after the previous message lands; "<" = together with the previous
                                   message (a broadcast); "latency" defaults to stepMs; "after" starts it when the earlier
                                   message with that label lands (+ "delay"); that label must be unique (a broadcast to two
                                   nodes needs two labels).
  "timing": "causal" | "sequential"   default causal: an unanchored message starts when its SENDER is free (its last received
                                   message and its own previous message have landed) — a reply waits for what it replies to,
                                   a side branch from another node never delays it, idle senders send at 0; a node that should
                                   wait says {"after": "label", "delay": ms}. sequential: it starts when the previous message
                                   in the list lands, so inserting one delays all later ones
  "events": [ {"after": "label" | "at": ms, "delay": ms, "node", "status", "caption"} ]   status changes; prefer "after" — an absolute
                                   "at" stays put when message timing shifts (the check warns when it lands mid-flight)
Time runs down the canvas, so order is visible. A message to a node that is down at arrival should be "lost": true (the check warns).`,
  matrix: `kind: matrix — a grid of cells (a DP table, a matrix, a table of rows); rows and columns can swap
  "cells": [[…], …]                required; rows of number | string | null (null = empty, to be filled); one row = a plain array
  "rowLabels", "colLabels": string[]   optional headers, one per row / column
  "ops": [ {"set": {"cell": [r, c], "value": v, "from": [[r, c], …]}}   write a value; "from" names the cells it came from
                                                                          (they flash and a token flies from each into the target)
           {"highlight": T} {"unhighlight": T | "all"} {"mark": T}      T = {"cell": [r, c]} | {"cells": [[r, c], …]} | {"row": r} | {"col": c}

           {"swap": {"rows": [i, j]} | {"cols": [i, j]}}                 rows / columns trade places, labels move with them
           {"note": "…"} ]                                                each may carry "caption" and "ms"
Cell references are [row, col], 0-based. The check reads the final grid back by position and compares it with the ops' result.`,
  graph: `kind: graph — nodes and edges walked by a traversal; nodes never move
  "nodes": [ "id" | {"id", "label", "pos": [x, y]} ]   required; pos pins a node
  "edges": [ {"from", "to", "weight", "label"} | ["a", "b"] ]   required; weight (or label) is drawn on the edge
  "directed": true                 arrows; explore must follow the arrow. Default false (lines, either direction)
  "layout": "circle" | "lr" | "tb" | "grid"   default circle

                                   generates the ops by running the algorithm from start (goal: dijkstra also paints the path)
  "ops": [ {"visit": "id"} {"explore": "a->b" | ["a", "b"]} {"label": {"node": "id" | [ids], "text": "…"}}
           {"highlight": id | [ids]} {"unhighlight": …} {"path": ["a", "b", "c"]} {"note": "…"} ]
                                   explicit alternative; each may carry "caption" and "ms"
                                   visit = current (accent, larger) then visited (green); explore = a token travels the edge;
                                   label = text under the node (a distance, a depth); path = the answer, painted green
Give "algorithm" OR "ops". With an algorithm the check fails unless every node reachable from start was visited.`,
  chart: `kind: chart — a bar or line chart revealed in beats
  "type": "bar" | "line"           default bar
  "categories": string[]           required; the x axis
  "series": [ {"id", "label", "values": number[], "color"} ]   required, 1+; one value per category
  "yMax": number                   optional; default a round number 10% above the largest value
  "yLabel": string                 optional

                                   default: reveal each series in order
The check fails if a bar's final height is not its value's share of the axis, and warns about a series never revealed.`,
  diagram: `kind: diagram — boxes and arrows, narrated in beats
  "nodes": [ {"id", "label", "shape": "rect" | "circle" | "ellipse", "pos": [x, y], "fill", "hidden": true} ]   required
  "edges": [ {"from", "to", "label", "style": "arrow" | "line", "hidden": true} ]
  "layout": "lr" | "tb" | "grid" | "circle"   default lr; nodes with "pos" are pinned
  "sequence": [ one action per step, plus optional "caption" and "ms" ]
      {"show": id | [ids]}  {"hide": …}  {"highlight": …}  {"unhighlight": …}
      {"flow": "a->b"}      a token travels along an existing edge (either direction)
      {"note": "…"}         a captioned pause
      {"relabel": {"id", "text"}}
Hidden nodes stay invisible until a "show" step. A "flow" needs an edge between the two nodes.`,
  vector: `kind: vector — generic shapes with a list of tweens (when nothing semantic fits)
  "nodes": [ timeline nodes, see below ]   required
  "timeline": [ tween | {"wait": ms, "caption"} ]   required
      tween: {"target": id | [ids], "to": {…}, "duration": ms, "easing", "at", "caption", "label"}
      "to" keys: x, y (or pos: [x, y]), w, h (or size), r, opacity, fill, stroke, color, scale, rotate, dash, text
      "at": omitted = after the previous item; "<" = together with the previous; "+200" / "-100" = offset from its end; a number = absolute ms
Nodes: {"id", "shape": rect | circle | ellipse | text | line | arrow | path | group, "pos": [x, y], "size": [w, h], "r", "points": [[x1,y1],[x2,y2]], "d", "text", "fontSize", "fill", "stroke", "strokeWidth", "opacity", "dash", "rotate", "scale", "parent"}
  rect/ellipse need "size"; circle needs "r"; text needs "text"; line/arrow need "points"; path needs "d". Shapes are centred on "pos". Any shape with "text" draws it centred as a label.`,
  compose: `kind: compose — several scenes in one canvas, side by side or stacked, played in sequence or together
  "panes": [ {"id", "title", "scene": { a whole scene of any other kind }} ]   required; a pane cannot be a compose
  "layout": row | column | grid       optional; row (default) = side by side, grid = two per row
  "timing": sequence | parallel       optional; sequence (default) plays pane 1 then pane 2; parallel starts them together (a before / after in lockstep)
  "gap": px                           optional; space between panes (32)
  Each pane keeps its own kind's anchors and annotations; captions of coinciding beats join with " · ", prefixed by the pane title under parallel.`,
  timeline: `format: ${TIMELINE_FORMAT} — the compiled layer; write it directly only when a tween list is not enough
  "canvas": {"width", "height", "background"}   required
  "nodes": [ … same node fields as kind: vector … ]   required, drawn in order
  "tracks": [ {"target": id, "prop", "keyframes": [ {"t": ms, "value", "easing"} ]} ]   required
      prop: pos [x,y] | size [w,h] | r | opacity | fill | stroke | color | scale | rotate | dash (0..1 draw progress) | text (discrete)
      "easing" is INTO the keyframe: linear | ease | ease-in | ease-out | ease-in-out | step-end | step-start | cubic-bezier(a,b,c,d)
      keyframe times ascend; the first/last value holds outside the span
  "steps": [ {"t": ms, "label", "caption"} ]   chapter markers; the runtime steps between them and shows the caption
