# TODO

## Vision

**Large-scale cross-renderer diff verification tool**.

Use cases:
- Chromium vs Crater (cross-browser engine diffs)
- Website v1 vs v2 (UI library rewrites)
- Design system version comparison

Runs on Cloudflare Workers with Crater. WebUI is in a separate repo.

## Done (65 items)

### Core Pipeline
- [x] 3-track parallel pipeline (Diff Intent / Visual Semantic / A11y Semantic)
- [x] Cross-validation matrix (Visual × A11y × Intent)
- [x] 2-tier expectations (short-cycle + long-cycle spec)
- [x] Introspect / Spec verify / Reasoning chains / Goal Runner
- [x] Visual pipeline: pixelmatch v7 + heatmap + image size mismatch handling

### CSS Challenge Bench
- [x] 3 fixtures (page / dashboard / form-app), 741 CSS declarations
- [x] Property deletion mode + Selector block deletion mode
- [x] Multi-viewport (wide 1440 + desktop 1280 + mobile 375)
- [x] Computed style diff (esbuild __name bug fixed)

- [x] ::before/::after pseudo-element computed style
- [x] CSS Custom Properties var() tracking
- [x] Detection pattern DB (JSONL) + aggregation report

- [x] Prescanner mode (1.66x speedup)
- [x] Best-effort computed style capture via BiDi
- [x] Bench summary persistence + speedup report

### Migration VRT
- [x] migration-compare.ts: auto breakpoint discovery + quickcheck-style viewport generation
- [x] Reset CSS fixture (normalize / modern-normalize / destyle / no-reset)
- [x] Tailwind → vanilla CSS fixture + blind test (0.0% pixel-perfect achieved)
- [x] shadcn/ui → luna fixture
- [x] Diff approval system (tolerance, expires, issue linkage)
- [x] Auto-approve workflow (vrt-approve)

### Viewport Discovery
- [x] @media breakpoint extraction (regex + crater BiDi)
- [x] Boundary ±1px + random sample viewport generation
- [x] ResponsiveBreakpoint type (ge/gt/le/lt) + merge
- [x] crater getResponsiveBreakpoints BiDi API integration

### API / CLI
- [x] API type definitions (src/api-types.ts) — Compare, Smoke, Report, Status
- [x] Hono API server (/api/compare, /api/compare-renderers, /api/smoke-test, /api/status)
- [x] /api/compare computed style diff integration
- [x] VrtClient SDK (src/vrt-client.ts)
- [x] Unified CLI (src/vrt.ts) — compare, bench, report, discover, smoke, serve, status
- [x] GitHub Actions CI workflow (vrt-compare.yml)

### Smoke Test
- [x] A11y-driven random operations (Playwright getByRole)
- [x] Disabled element skipping
- [x] LLM reasoning mode
- [x] Console error / uncaught exception / crash monitoring
- [x] External navigation blocking
- [x] Seed-based reproducible randomization

### Performance
- [x] pixelmatch v6 → v7
- [x] pixelmatch native benchmark (85µs, 6.6x vs npm v7)
- [x] tsx → node --experimental-strip-types (esbuild removed)
- [x] benchmark.ts (deterministic API baseline measurement)

### CI / Integration
- [x] flaker VRT runner + adapters (migration, bench)
- [x] migration-report / bench-report artifact workflows

### Code Quality
- [x] TypeScript strict mode (tsconfig strict + verbatimModuleSyntax, 151 tsc errors → 0)
- [x] Shared module extraction (terminal-colors.ts 12 files, cli-args.ts 9 files, mask.ts)
- [x] Playwright page reuse (fix-loop), PNG IHDR header reading, Gemini SDK init optimization

### Snapshot / URL Compare
- [x] `vrt snapshot` command (URL → multi-viewport capture + baseline diff)
- [x] `vrt compare --url / --current-url` URL mode (page.goto based)
- [x] `--mask` selector masking (visibility: hidden to exclude dynamic content)
- [x] Project rename: vrt-harness → vrt

## Evaluation Phase — Next Steps

### E1. Dogfooding on external projects

Use vrt on real projects to verify practicality.

- [x] Add `vrt snapshot` command (URL → multi-viewport capture + baseline diff)
- [x] Add `vrt compare --url` URL mode (page.goto based)
- [x] luna.mbt dogfooding: false positive rate 0% (6 pages × 2 viewports)
- [x] sol.mbt dogfooding: false positive rate 20% (dynamic content on root page)
- [x] Record results in `docs/reports/2026-04-05-dogfood-luna-sol.md`
- [x] sample-webapp-2026 dogfood で出た snapshot UX を改善する
  - `snapshot` の label 生成が query string を見ないため、`/` と `/?severity=critical` が同じ baseline に潰れる
  - `--label` / route manifest / query-aware label のどれかで URL ごとの identity を安定化したい
- [x] `vrt snapshot` に CI 向け fail 条件を持たせる
  - sample では `snapshot-report.json` を読んで回帰判定する `scripts/vrt-snapshot.mjs` が必要だった
  - `--fail-on-diff`, `--fail-on-new-baseline`, `--max-diff-ratio` を CLI に持たせたい
- [x] `snapshot` 系の baseline approve を first-class にする
  - sample では `scripts/vrt-approve.mjs` で `*-current.png` を `*-baseline.png` にコピーしている
  - `vrt snapshot approve` もしくは `vrt snapshot --approve` が欲しい
- [x] 外部プロジェクト向けに `workflow` の route/spec coupling を外す
  - `e2e/vrt-capture.spec.ts` が `vrt.config.json` (`capture.routes`) / `VRT_CONFIG_PATH` / `VRT_CAPTURE_ROUTES` から routes を読むようになった
  - `vrt workflow init|capture --config <path> --base-url <url>` で外部プロジェクトから差し込み可能
- [x] `vrt snapshot` の config file を公式サポートする
  - sample では `vrt.config.json` に `baseUrl`, `routes`, `outputDir`, `threshold` を寄せて wrapper で解釈している
  - JSON/TOML の config を直接読めると導入がかなり軽くなる
- [ ] Run VRT in CI per PR, measure false positive rate
- [ ] Pass diff report to subagent for fix code generation, measure success rate

### E2. Crater prescanner tracking

Measure detection rate improvement after crater-side fixes (#18-22).
**Status**: #18-22 all Open (no progress as of 2026-04-05). Waiting for crater-side fixes.

- [ ] Re-run bench after text-decoration #18 fix
- [ ] Track progress toward detection rate 60% → target 80%+
- [ ] Track progress toward prescanner speedup 1.66x → target 3x+

### E3. Blind test replication

Reproduce the Tailwind blind test with different fixtures/scenarios to confirm reproducibility.

- [ ] Blind test with shadcn → luna
  - Fixture scaffolding done: `after-reference.html` archived, `after-blank.html` provides minimal reset starting point.
  - Baseline diff measured at 19.6%–58.4% across 10 viewports (35 layout-shift, 19 color-change, 4 typography).
  - Loop run itself requires an LLM API key — see `docs/reports/2026-05-11-e3-shadcn-luna-blind-scaffold.md`.
- [x] Blind test with Reset CSS switch — see `docs/reports/2026-04-04-e3-reset-css-blind-test.md` (0.0% in 1 round)
- [ ] Success criteria: diff < 1% within 3 rounds
